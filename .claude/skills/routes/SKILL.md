# Routes

- You MUST NOT use `Route::resource()` or `Route::apiResource()`. You MUST
  define each route individually, and name it explicitly.
- You MUST add names to routes, and follow the naming convention
  `<domain>.<resource>.<action>` (e.g. `account.users.index`).
- You MUST constrain a route parameter that is not a model, with `where()` and a
  regex, as the six token, id and hash parameters of `routes/web.php` and
  `routes/auth.php` do (e.g. `->where('token', '[A-Za-z0-9]{64}')`). A parameter
  that binds to a model needs nothing: the model names its own key with
  `getRouteKeyName()`, usually `uuid`, and refuses anything else.
- You MUST add a comment to every major route group.
- You SHOULD NOT add comments anywhere else, unless they are necessary.
- You MUST NOT use route prefixes. Write the whole URL on the route,
  `admin/moderation/{version}` and not `prefix('admin')` around
  `moderation/{version}`, so that grepping the URL a browser shows lands on the
  line that declares it. A group is for middleware, and for nothing else.
