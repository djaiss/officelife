# Tests

- You MUST read and follow the testing rules in `.claude/rules/testing.md`.
- You MUST use `use PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\Test;` and `#[Test]` for test methods, instead of `public function testX()`.
- Test method names MUST be descriptive and use `snake_case`, like `it_can_list_the_api_keys_of_the_current_user`.
- You MUST not test sanitization.
- You MUST not test casts.
