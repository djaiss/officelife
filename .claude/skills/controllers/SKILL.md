description: Conventions for writing thin HTTP controllers that validate input and delegate to Actions. Use when creating or editing controllers in app/Http/Controllers (web, API, or marketing).

# Controllers

## Folder convention

- Controllers MUST be split into logical categories: `App` for the logged in
  app, `Api` for the JSON API.
- Within these folders, controllers MUST be grouped by major domains of the
  application, like `Vaults`, `Settings`, `Marketplace`, `Admin`, and so on.

## Rules

- You MUST read the other controllers in the project for reference, and follow
  the same structure and conventions.
- Controllers MUST be as thin as possible, and the business logic MUST live in
  actions.
- Controllers MUST be testable.

## Things to do

- You MUST only use these methods: `index`, `new`, `create`, `show`, `edit`,
  `update`, `destroy`
- You MUST keep the signature to `$request` followed by the models the URL
  names, resolved by implicit route model binding, in the order the URL names
  them, then the optional plain parameters:
  `index(Request $request, Vault $vault, ?string $filter = null)`,
  `show(Request $request, Vault $vault, Contact $contact)`.
- You MUST not put domain logic in the controller - use Action when you need to
  execute a domain logic.
- You MUST NOT put domain logic in a private method of a controller. A private
  method that assembles a validation rule set, reads a value out of the request
  or builds a redirect is fine, and twelve controllers have one; anything that
  decides or writes something belongs to an Action.
- You MUST validate inline, with `$request->validate([...])` in the method. That
  is what every controller but one does. A Form Request is for the case where
  the same rule set is shared by several endpoints or is long enough to bury the
  method; the application has exactly one, `SaveFieldValuesRequest`. When the
  rules are long and used once, put them in a private `rules()` method of the
  controller, as `ContactShareLinkController` does.
- You MUST let implicit route model binding hand you the model, and you MUST
  then check it is reachable by the user:
  `abort_unless($contact->isReachableThrough($request->user(), $vault), 404)`.
  No middleware resolves models in this application, and `$request->attributes`
  is never used.
- You MUST use `$request->user()` — never `Auth::user()`
- You SHOULD take a plain route parameter as a typed argument
  (`?string $page = null`). `$request->route()->parameter('gender')` is the last
  resort, used in four places.
- You MUST validate the request data, and you MUST NOT sanitize it. In the
  validation, you MUST NOT check if an object exists by checking if the id
  exists in the database - this is done in Actions. You MUST make sure the
  validation rules match the fields of the model, as defined in the migration
  (ie length of a given string).
- You MUST pass everything to the Action through its constructor, with named
  arguments, then call `->execute()` with none:
  `(new CreateContact(user: $request->user(), vault: $vault, firstName: $validated['first_name']))->execute()`.
  All 135 actions read that way.
- You MUST prepare the data for the view in a ViewModel, and pass it to the
  view.
- You MUST type-hint the return of every method (`View`, `RedirectResponse`,
  `JsonResponse`, `AnonymousResourceCollection`, `Response`).
- You MUST use `return redirect()->route('home.index')` instead of
  `return to_route('home.index')`.

### If it's a web controller

- You MUST return views, not JSON.
- You MUST always pass validated data to the action.
- You MUST NOT compact data to a view. Instead, you MUST pass an array with keys
  that represent what the data is, like `['journals' => $journals]` instead of
  `compact('journals')`.
- You MUST refuse anything the user cannot reach with `abort_unless(..., 404)`.
  A scoped `findOrFail()` is rare here (two places); when you write one, wrap it
  in a try/catch on `ModelNotFoundException` and `abort(404)`.
- You MUST redirect with
  `redirect()->route(...)->with('status', __('Changes saved'))` after a
  mutation.
- A failed `$request->validate()` redirects back with the errors and the input
  on its own, and you write nothing. When an Action refuses the work instead,
  catch its exception and return
  `back()->withErrors(['field' => $e->getMessage()])`, adding `->withInput()`
  when the form has to be repopulated; eleven controllers do the first, three
  the second. Use `->with('error', __('...'))` for a message that belongs to no
  field (14 controllers).
- The view MUST then show `$errors` and repopulate every input with
  `old('field_name')`.


### If it's an API controller

- You MUST return an API Resource (e.g. `GenderResource`), never raw
  arrays/JSON.
- You MUST set the status code explicitly: `200` for show/update, `201` for
  create via `->response()->setStatusCode(...)`, and
  `response()->noContent(204)` for destroy.
- For `index`, you MUST return `Resource::collection($paginated)` and paginate,
  clamping `per_page` to `config('app.maximum_items_per_page')`.
- You MUST let scoped `findOrFail()` throw, with no try/catch (the framework
  returns 404).
