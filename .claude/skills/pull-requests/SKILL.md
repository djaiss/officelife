description: Conventions for writing pull requests, including Conventional Commits titles and structured descriptions. Use when the user wants to create or open a pull request, or write a PR title or description. Trigger whenever a pull request, PR, or merge request is mentioned.

# Create a pull request

- The pull request title MUST follow the Conventional Commits naming convention,
  e.g. `feat: add new locale fr_FR`.
- You SHOULD avoid uppercase in the title, except for proper nouns and acronyms.
- You MUST indicate the issue the PR closes, if that's the case, and reference
  the issue number. Do not mention anything otherwise.
- You MUST NOT mention Claude Code anywhere.
- The pull request description MUST be bullet points and nothing else:
    - every line MUST be a bullet, a short heading grouping bullets, or an image
    - you MUST NOT write a paragraph anywhere, including the opening line and
      the closing line. No sentence introducing the change, no sentence
      summarising it, no narration between bullets. A description whose first
      line is prose is wrong however good the prose is
    - a heading MUST be two or three words and carry no prose of its own
    - one idea per bullet, one line each wherever it fits
    - describe the changes made in this PR, using as fewer words as possible
    - do not restate the title, and do not list what the diff already shows
    - keep it understandable by non technical people
    - when a new concept is introduced in the codebase, add a few details to let
      readers understand what it's about, still as a bullet

## Screenshots for a user interface change

- A pull request that changes anything a person sees MUST carry a screenshot.
  That covers a new screen, a changed layout, spacing, a component, wording
  drawn on a page, a state (empty, error, loading), and anything else visible in
  a browser.
- The API reference portal at `/docs/api` is the one exception, and a change to
  it MUST NOT carry a screenshot. Its pages are generated from the definition
  files in `resources/docs/api`, so a shot of one shows the portal rendering
  exactly as it always renders, and the endpoints and their wording are what a
  reviewer has to read. Describe them in a bullet instead. A change to the
  components or the layout the portal is drawn with is a user interface change
  like any other and still needs one.
- You MUST take them with the
  [take-screenshot skill](../take-screenshot/SKILL.md), which uses Iris. The
  application is served at `http://officelife.test`.
- A screen that already existed MUST show a before and an after, in that order,
  so a reviewer sees what changed rather than only the result. A screen that did
  not exist has no before, and carries the after alone.
- Both shots MUST come from the same URL, at the same size, with the same data.
  The change is the only thing that may differ between them.

### Capturing the before

1. `git switch main`.
2. Rebuild the front end with `bun run build`, because the styles built from
   your branch do not match main and would draw the old page wrongly.
3. Capture `/tmp/<feature>-before.png`. Screenshots are temporary review
   artifacts and MUST stay outside the repository.
4. `git switch -` to return to your branch, then `bun run build` again.
5. Capture `/tmp/<feature>-after.png`.

### Putting them in the pull request

- Screenshots MUST NOT be added to Git or stored anywhere in the repository.
- Use GitHub CLI 2.99.0 or newer, which uploads images directly to GitHub with
  the repeatable `--attach` flag.
- If `gh pr create --help` does not list `--attach`, upgrade GitHub CLI before
  creating the pull request. Never fall back to committing the screenshots.
- Pass screenshots in before-and-after order. Put the alt text after `#` in the
  same argument:

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: improve the field type picker" \
  --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md \
  --attach '/tmp/field-type-picker-before.png#Before: the field type picker as a plain list' \
  --attach '/tmp/field-type-picker-after.png#After: the field type picker showing a preview of the chosen type'
```

- The alt text MUST start with `Before:` or `After:` and then say what the image
  shows. That label is what a reviewer reads, and it keeps working when the
  image does not load.
- For a new screen, attach only the after screenshot and keep the `After:`
  label.
- An image is a line of its own, which the description rules above already
  allow. Do not introduce it with a sentence.
- After creating the pull request, read it with `gh pr view --json body,url` and
  verify that every screenshot appears in the right order as a GitHub
  attachment. A pull request is not complete while an attachment is missing.
