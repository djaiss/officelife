{{--
  What somebody sees when a code is not asked for on top of their password: the
  one way of turning it on, offered the way an item in a list is, so a second
  way added later reads as the same kind of thing.

  The phone stays beside the words at every width, since the two are one thing.
  The button sits beside them until there is no width to sit beside them, and
  then below, filling the line rather than hugging the right hand edge on its
  own.

  The screen it leads to is built on this same layout, so it is handed to turbo
  and only the body changes hands.
