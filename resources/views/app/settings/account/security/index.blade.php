{{--
  What somebody can change about the way they sign in: their password, whether a
  code is asked for on top of it, and the API keys that let something other than
  a browser act as them.

  Each panel holds a section of its own, kept in a partial beside this file, so
  what this screen is made of can be read in one go.
